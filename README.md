This Python program analyzes student performance based on their internal assessment marks. The marks are taken as input from the user, stored in a list, and processed using for loops and conditional statements to classify each student as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, Fail, or Invalid.

A personalization rule is applied using the length of my name (john chrysolite). Since the name length is greater than 6, 5 marks are added to each student before classification, making the program’s output unique.

The program also counts the total number of valid students and failed students and displays a final summary. Only basic Python concepts such as lists, loops, strings, and conditions are used, as required by the challenge.
